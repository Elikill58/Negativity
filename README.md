# Negativity

A Minecraft AntiCheat for **Spigot** (1.7.10 to 1.16.1) and **Sponge** (API 7.1.0) (*also works with PaperSpigot*).
It is also compatible with **Bungeecord and Velocity**.
You need to put the plugin on Spigot/Sponge even if you put it on your proxy.

## Informations

Need help ? Have a question or something to suggest ?

Contact me via Discord private messages (`Elikill58#0743`) or in my server ([join it here](https://discord.gg/KHRVTX2)).

Suggestions and bug reports can also be filled in [this repository issue tracker](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/issues).

## How to install ?

1) Download

You can download the plugin here (it's the same plugin, just not on the same website):

[Spigot/Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/48399),
[Sponge](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Elikill58/Negativity)

2) Add to your server

On Sponge, you have to place the downloaded file on **/mods folder**.

On Spigot/Bungeecord/Velocity, you have to place it on **/plugins folder**.

3) **Restart** your server

A config file will be automatically generated (at /config/negativity for Sponge, /plugins/Negativity for other).

A new "lang" folder will appear on Negativty's config folder.

4) **Enjoy !**

The default config enable you to directly test the plugin !

## I want to test it before download !

You can check it on **server.negativity.fr** (server in 1.13.2, you can connect with 1.13.2 to 1.16.1).

## What are the detected cheat ?

We made a wiki for all [detected cheat](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat) which explain what every hack does.

## How detection works ? What do you check ?

If they are enabled, I'm checking a lot of things : movement, action, packet ...
Else, I'm doing anything. So, if you don't need detection, disable it and you will keep resources.

## And for bad connection ? TPS drop ?

By default, if the player have a **ping higher than 150 ms**, it will not create alert.

Also by default, if the server is **less than 19 TPS**, alert will be disabled
