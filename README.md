# Negativity

It's a Minecraft AntiCheat for multiples platforms :
- **Spigot** 1.7.10 to 1.19 (*and fork like PaperSpigot or Tuinity*)
- **Sponge** API 7, 8 & 9
- **Fabric** v0.53.0 for 1.18

Proxies:
- **BungeeCord**
- **Velocity**

If you are using proxy, you should put the plugins on all sub servers where you want to check players.

Suggestions and bug reports can also be filled in [this repository issue tracker](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/issues).

## How to install ?

Check [installation wiki](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Installation) for all informations according to platform.

## I want to test it before download !

You can check it on **server.negativity.fr** (server in 1.13.2, you can connect with 1.13.2 to 1.19). Warn: it can be offline.

## What are the detected cheat ?

We made a wiki for all [detected cheat](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat) which explain what every hack does.

## How detection works ? What do you check ?

If they are enabled, I'm checking a lot of things : movement, action, packet ...
Else, I'm doing anything. So, if you don't need detection, disable it and you will keep resources.

## And for bad connection ? TPS drop ?

By default, if the player have a **ping higher than 150 ms**, it will not create alert.

Also by default, if the server is **less than 19 TPS**, alert will be disabled

## Build the plugin

Prerequisites:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- JDK 8 (any distribution should work, [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) for example)
- JDK 17 (any distribution should work) recommended for latest minecraft version (also work with lower versions)

In the following instructions you will have to execute Gradle tasks. You **must** use the Gradle wrapper distributed in this repository.

Examples will be using `./gradlew`, if you are on Windows you need to use `gradlew.bat` instead.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity.git`

2. Change branch to v2 using `git checkout v2`

3. There is 2 ways (warn: first setup take some times to complete) :

#### Use installation script

On Windows, you must use [Git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). On Linux and MacOS use the regular terminal.

Run `./setup_spigot.sh`. It will download spigot jars and JDKs, and use BuildTools appropriately.

#### Manually install spigot jars

- Create a folder called `spigotJars` in `spigot/`

- Download every spigot version of spigot listed below from [this link](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot) and put them in `spigot/spigotJars` Versions: 
 `1.7.10, 1.8.8, 1.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2, 1.13`(you need to add a + at the beginning of the name (+spigot1.13.jar for example)`, 
 1.13.2, 1.14.4, 1.15.2, 1.16.1, 1.16.5`

- You should use buildtools with this command `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev <version> --remapped` for Spigot 1.17/1.18/1.18.2/1.19 (or comment them in `settings.gradle`).

4. Build the plugin: `./gradlew build`
 - You can find the all-in-one jar in `/build/libs/`
 - Platform-specific jars are available in their own project subdirectories (`/spigot/build/libs/` for example)
