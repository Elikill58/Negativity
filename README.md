# Negativity

Negativity is a Minecraft **AntiCheat** plugin designed for **Spigot (versions 1.8.8 to 1.20)** and is also compatible with **forks of Spigot**. It can be used with both **Bungeecord** and **Velocity**.

Please note that Negativity is not compatible with Spigot 1.7.10 and Sponge versions after 1.13.

Even if you plan to use it on your proxy server, you still need to install the plugin on your Spigot or Sponge server.

## Testing Before Buying

If you want to test the plugin before buying, you can try it out on the server **play.negativity.fr**. Please note that the server may be offline at times.

## Detected Cheats

A comprehensive list of all the cheats that Negativity can detect is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat). This list provides detailed explanations of what each cheat does.

## Detection and Checks

When enabled, Negativity performs various checks on player movements, actions, and packets to detect cheats. However, if you do not require cheat detection, you can disable it to save resources.

## Bad Connection and TPS Drop
By default, if a player's ping **exceeds 200 ms**, Negativity will not create an alert. Additionally, if the server's TPS (Ticks Per Second) **drops below 19**, alerts will be disabled.
