# Processors manage bans. Only one processor can be used at the time.
# Available processors :
# - file : Saves bans under the ban/ directory of the configuration directory
# - database : Saves bans in a database. Needs a configured database (see the Database category)
# - command : Runs commands to ban or unban
# - bukkit : Uses Bukkit's ban system
# - proxy : Forwards ban execution and revocations to the proxy companion plugin.
#   You must enable bans on the proxy plugin's configuration for it to work
# The following plugins are also supported :
# - maxbans
# - advancedban
# - litebans
# - dkbans
# - professionalbans
# - ultrapunishments
# Defaults to "file"
processor: "file"
# Commands to execute when using the "command" processor
# You can execute as many commands as you want. Order is respected.
#
# Available placeholders:
# %uuid% : uuid of banned player
# %name% : name of banned player
# %ip% : ip of the banned player
# %reason% : detected cheat
# %alert% : The message that contains all detected cheat as "Cheat (Cheat1, Cheat2)"
