# Negativity

A Minecraft AntiCheat for **Spigot** (1.7.10 to 1.18) and **Sponge** ([more informations](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki#im-on-sponge-and-wtf-)) (*also works on fork of Spigot*).
It is also compatible with **Bungeecord** and **Velocity**.

You need to put the plugin on Spigot/Sponge even if you put it on your proxy.

## How to install ?

A complete wiki explain [how to install](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Installation) it on all platform (Spigot, Sponge, Bungeecord, Velocity)

## I want to test it before download !

You can check it on **server.negativity.fr** (server in 1.13.2, you can connect with 1.13.2 to 1.18). Warn: it can be offline.

## What are the detected cheat ?

We made a wiki for all [detected cheat](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat) which explain what every hack does.

## How detection works ? What do you check ?

If they are enabled, I'm checking a lot of things : movement, action, packet ...

Else, I'm doing anything. So, if you don't need detection, disable it and you will keep resources.

## And for bad connection ? TPS drop ?

By default, if the player have a **ping higher than 200 ms**, it will not create alert.

Also by default, if the server is **less than 19 TPS**, alert will be disabled
